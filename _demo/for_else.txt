It is time for a software engineer to try and learn his older sun to programm.
But what is the best approach to achieve such a difficult task for a self tought professional, who has no experience in teaching, but wants that his son to folow his steps in the mistirious and beautiful path of creating software.
To accomplish this, I asked myself these questions:
How will I get his attention?
What programm language will I teach him first?
